Django is an interpreted language
that is why position of code in file matters
also, why the examples in the django docs
are on the repl
but how does one get access to the Django repl?
basic auth backend code:

from django.contrib.auth.backends import BaseBackend


class MagicAdminBackend(BaseBackend):
    def has_perm(self, user_obj, perm, obj=None):
        return user_obj.username == settings.ADMIN_LOGIN

///
it is up to the developers (burden of responsibility "") to delineate the anonymity, encryption, and functionality of the user authentication backend

this does not violate DRY

probably best to avoid custom backend
but custom permissions feasible
syntax/semantics: One does not "use" a custom backend, one "substitutes" a custom backend
(for the original backend)

CircularDependencyError

listeners, signals, receivers
which computational resource is used for these three? (RAM? salt? entropy? disk? different for each? which to which?)

better to initialize / prompt for pets at user registration/signup?
