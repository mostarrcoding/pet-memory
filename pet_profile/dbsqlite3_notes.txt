ER Diagram for pet_profile_petowner indicates a few things
ids present for input fields admin_log, petowner_groups, & user_perms
only id for field in question (pet_profile_petowner) is pets_id (appropriate, good, correct)
__however__, pet_profile_pet only has pet_photos_id (no pet_blurb or pet_story id) i.e. is incomplete
also, no reverse match error when db attempts to create new item thru superuser use of admin interface
not sure what source of error is but CS indicates a double check of the petowner/user slug should be done.
So, am checking!
No idea what to look for.

Notes to be further recorded...

Present: pet_owner slug, pet slug

authorization_group permissions are logical (group perms simple, forward-propagate, and individuals perms
	more complex)
	forward-propagates to django_content_type table, which has app_label and model fields
		seems to be about the app! (metadata, technically? or no?)
		
petprofile_petowner PrimaryKey only, is slug or rather has column slug
foreign_key is pets_id, reference column is slug
one-to-one relationship
